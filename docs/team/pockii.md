## Project: Projact 
Projact is a contact and project management app that helps NUS computing students to organise their contacts and their projects' meeting links and tasks.
 
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Features
* **Feature**: Command to edit Tag's names. (Pull request [\#109](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/109))
  * What it does: allows the user to change the name of a tag for all its occurrences. 
  * Highlights: This implementation was challenging as it affected contacts with the edited Tag. 
  * Justification: improves user's experience by providing an easy way to correct their mistakes.

* **Feature**: JSON Storage for Tags with their names, tasks and meeting links. (Pull requests [\#109](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/109), [\#142](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/142))
  * What it does: allows users' data to be saved and loaded upon the next usage of the app.
  * Highlights: This feature affects existing and future tag commands. 

* **Feature**: Command to clear all completed tasks from a Tag. (Pull request [\#224](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/224))
  * Justification: increase user's convenience by providing a way to mass delete completed tasks from a Tag.

* **Enhancement**: Removed Address field in Person's model. (Pull request [\#68](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/pull/68))
  * Justification: It is uncommon for target users to know or save their acquaintances' address.
