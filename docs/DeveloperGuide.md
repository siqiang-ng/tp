## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ProjactParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the projact data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Projact`, and its `TagName` is referenced by `Person`. This allows `Projact` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save projact data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

### Contact features

**Sort command**

The `sort` command allows a user to sort the current person list in alphanumerical order. 

- How is SortContactCommand executed
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`
    1. `LogicManager` calls parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    1. `ProjactParser` identifies and returns `SortCommand`.
    1. `LogicManager` executes `SortCommand`, which updates the sorted person list by comparing the personNames using `PersonNameComparator` in `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of SortCommand.

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way?
    - The overall implementation flow of the `sort` command is similar to the `find` command in the original AB3 but instead of using Filtered
     List and Predicate, Sorted List and Comparator are used to sort the list.

### Tag features

**TagAdd command**

The `tagadd` command allows a user to add a new tag to the tag list. The tag added will not have any contacts under it initially.

- How is TagAddCommand executed
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagadd' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagAddCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Tag` object, and returns a new `TagAddCommand` with the new `Tag` object used as an argument.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagAddCommand`, which calls the addTag method of `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagAddCommand`. 

![TagAddSequenceDiagram](images/TagAddSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the TagAddCommand will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TagEdit command**

The `tagedit` command allows a user to edit the tag name of a tag in the list.

- How is TagEditCommand executed
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagedit' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagEditCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object and a new `EditTagDescriptor`object, and returns a new `TagEditCommand` with those objects used as arguments.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagEditCommand`, which create a new `Tag` object with the edited field and replaces the current `Tag` object at the specified index in `FilteredTagList`.
    6. `FilteredTagList` is updated with the edited `Tag` object and will reflect the changes in the `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagEditCommand`.

![Sequence Diagram of Tag Edit](images/TagEditSequenceDiagram.png)
  
- Why is it implemented that way:
  - The implementation of the TagEdit command is very similar to the Edit command so that we can reuse the previous code.
  - For example, by making the commandWord 'tagedit' instead of 'tag edit', we are able to make use of `ProjectParser` instead of creating a different parser just to identify tag commands.
  
**TagList command**

The `taglist` command allows a user to display all the tags in the tag list currently.

- How is TagListCommand executed
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    1. `LogicManager` calls parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    1. `ProjactParser` identifies and returns `TagListCommand`.
    1. `LogicManager` executes `TagListCommand`, which sets isTagList parameter in `CommandResult` to true.
    1. `MainWindow` detects `CommandResult` isTagList() returns true and hence invokes the showTagList() method.
    
The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagListCommand`. 

![TagListSequenceDiagram](images/TagListSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TagListCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TagFind command**

The `tagfind` command allows a user to display all tags which contains at least one of the specified keywords.

- How is TagFindCommand executed
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagfind' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagFindCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `TagNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the keywords, and returns a new `TagFindCommand` with the new `TagNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object used as an argument.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagFindCommand`, which calls the updateFilteredTagList method of `Model`. This method takes in a `Predicate<Tag>` and filters the `TagList` by the supplied predicate.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagFindCommand`. 

![TagFindSequenceDiagram](images/TagFindSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TagFindCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TagSort command**

The `tagsort` command allows a user to sort the tag list in alphanumerical order. 

The implementation and interaction of the `TagSortCommand` is similar to `SortContactCommand` but it uses `TagNameComaparator` instead of `PersonNameComparator`.

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The TagSort and SortContact commands share similar functions with the former sorting the tag list and the latter sorting the person list. Hence, a similar set of methods are for this feature to ensure the application can work smoothly.
    
**TagDelete command**

The `tagdelete` command allows a user to delete a tag permanently. This feature will result in the removal of the tag from the tag list and from any contact with said tag.

- How is TagDeleteCommand executed
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'tagdelete' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TagDeleteCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object with the parsed user input, and returns a new `TagDeleteCommand` with the new `Index` object used as an argument.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TagDeleteCommand`, which retrieves the most updated tag list from the `ModelManager`. From this list, the tag to be deleted is retrieved by its index. Then, the `ModelManager` will go on to remove all instances of the tag.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TagDeleteCommand`.

![TagDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/TagDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
 
- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TagDeleteCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

### Link Features 
   
**LinkAdd command**

The `linkadd` command allows a user to add a meeting link to a specified tag.

- How is LinkAddCommand executed
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'linkadd' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `LinkAddCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates new `Optional<MeetingLink>` and `Index` objects, and returns a new `LinkAddCommand` with the new `Optional<MeetingLink>` and `Index` objects used as arguments.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `LinkAddCommand`, which creates a new `Tag` object with the `Optional<MeetingLink>` object, and replaces the current `Tag` object at the specified index in `FilteredTagList`.
    6. `FilteredTagList` is updated with the edited `Tag` object and will reflect the changes in the `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `LinkAddCommand`. 

![LinkAddSequenceDiagram](images/LinkAddSequenceDiagram.png)  

- Why is it implemented this way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `LinkAddCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.


**LinkDelete command**
 
The `linkdelete` command allows a user to delete the meeting link from a tag permanently. 
 
- How is LinkDeleteCommand executed:
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    1. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    1. `ProjactParser` identifies the command word, which in this case is 'linkdelete' and the arguments.
    1. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `LinkDeleteCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object with the parsed user input, and returns a new `LinkDeleteCommand` with the new `Index` object used as an argument.
    1. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `LinkDeleteCommand`, which retrieves the most updated tag list from the `ModelManager`. 
    From this list, the tag that will has its meeting link being removed will be retrieved. A new tag will be created with an empty meeting link using Optional class and replaced the old tag retrieved. 
    1. Then, the `ModelManager` will update the tag list.
    
The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `LinkDeleteCommand`. 
    
![LinkDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/LinkDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)  

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `LinkDeleteCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

### Task Features 
     
**TaskAdd command**
 
The `taskadd` command allows the user to add a task to a tag. 

- How is TaskAddCommand executed:
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is 'taskadd' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TaskAddCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `editTagDescriptor` object, and returns a new `TaskAddCommand` with the new `editTagDescriptor` object used as an argument.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TaskAddCommand`, which calls the setTag method of `Model`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TaskAddCommand`. 

![TaskAddSequenceDiagram](images/TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png)

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be as similar as possible to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product. Most new classes added to accommodate the `TaskAddCommand` will also be largely similar to classes implemented in AB3.

**TaskDone command**
 
The `taskdone` command allows the user to mark a task under a tag as done. 
 
- How is TaskDoneCommand executed:
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    1. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    1. `ProjactParser` identifies the command word, which in this case is 'taskdone' and the arguments.
    1. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TaskDoneCommandParser`, which parses the arguments, creates two `Index` objects, the first one to be 
     the tag Index and the second one is the task Index and returns a new `TaskDoneCommand` with two `Index` objects pass in as parameters.
    1. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TaskDoneCommand`, which retrieves the tag from the taglist based on the tag Index. From
    the tag, the task list will be retrieved to get the targeted task using the task Index. The targeted task will be marked done and a new tag with
    the modified task list will be created and replaced the old Tag. 
    1. Then, the `ModelManager` will update the tag list.
    
The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TaskDoneCommand`. 

![TaskDoneSequenceDiagram](images/TaskDoneSequenceDiagram.png)   

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented such that there is no need for any prefixes. This helps to shorten the command and reduces the time required to mark a task as done.
    - The second index uses an alphabetical index instead of a numerical one. This avoids confusion between the index of the tag and the index of the task.
 

**TaskDelete command**
 
The `taskdelete` command allows the user to delete a task from a tag. 

- How is TaskDeleteCommand executed:
    1. The command is passed into `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the commandWord, which in this case is `taskdone` and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TaskDeleteCommandParser`, which parses the argument, cand returns a new `TaskDeleteCommand`.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TaskDeleteCommand`, which calls the setTag method of `Model`.

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The design consideration on the indices for the `TaskDeleteCommand` is similar to `TaskDoneCommand`.

The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TaskDeleteCommand`. 

![TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

**TaskClear command**

The `taskclear` command allows the user to clear all completed tasks under a tag.

- How is TaskClearCommand executed:
    1. The command is passed in to `LogicManager`.
    2. `LogicManager` calls the parseCommand method of `ProjactParser`.
    3. `ProjactParser` identifies the command word, which in this case is 'taskclear' and the arguments.
    4. `ProjactParser` calls the parse method of `TaskClearCommandParser`, which parses the argument, creates a new `Index` object and returns a new `TaskClearCommand` with the new `Index` object as an argument.
    5. The `LogicManager` then calls the execute method of the `TaskClearCommand`, which retrieves the `Tag` object at the specified index in `FilteredTagList`.  From the `Tag`, a list of its uncompleted tasks, `List<TagTask>`, is obtained.
    6.  A new `Tag` object is created with the new `List<TagTask>` and replaces the current `Tag` object at the specified index in `FilteredTagList`.
    7. `FilteredTagList` is then updated to reflect the changes in `Model`.
    
The diagram below shows a sample interaction of `TaskDoneCommand`. 

![TaskClearSequenceDiagram](images/TaskClearSequenceDiagram.png)    

- Why is it implemented that way:
    - The command is implemented to be similar to the current command classes, so that there will be minimal changes to the overall design of the product.
    - An alternative implementation would be for `TaskClearCommand` to not take in an index and just delete all completed tasks from every tag. 
        - However, the user may want to keep certain tags with completed tasks for tracking purposes. 
        - Furthermore, this implementation will result in a significantly long execution time for the `TaskClearCommand` as the number of tags and tasks increase.
